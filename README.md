# Visualizing Tuberculosis(TB) Burden

## Project/Goals
- Use Tableau visualizations to summarize the metrics of worldwide tuberculosis burden as provided in the 'Tuberculosis_Burden_Countries' dataset.
- Use the visualized metrics to curate dashboards for exploring and answering important questions about the TB dataset.

## Process
### Explore and research dataset

### Sketch potential visuals and dashboard compositions

### Create visuals

### Create dashboards

### Report findings

## Results

## Challenges 
Tableau Public is a cloud-based service that requires saving by uploading the file to Tableau Public servers. The process of saving to the Tableau servers can cause the Tableau desktop app to quit unexpectedly (crash) and lose your unsaved progress. 

To avoid losing a large quantity of work it is advisable to save to Tableau Public frequently, but this means dealing with more frequent crashes, a recurring login process, and the waiting time for server connection/upload.

## Future Goals
Some popular Tableau Public dashboards use a standard width and long length to essentially stack dashboards, allowing them to be experienced by scrolling (similar to a website). This format allows periodic placements of text to explain dashboards and components, presenting the dashboards in a self-explanatory report-like format.

Other popular dashboards present like the Tableau story feature, where they contain interactable arrows that lead through dashboards and interspersed explanations. This allows the dashboards to be presented once again, in a self-explanatory report-like format.

Either of these two formats would be the best future for the dashboards in this project.
